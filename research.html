            One of the most prominent problems of modern physics is the mystery of Dark matter. Despite ample observational evidence from astrophysics, there is yet no commonly accepted explanation on the level of particle physics. Several models already have been proposed, among which so-called WIMP dark matter has been investigated most intensively. In the early 2000 <a class="text-link" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9909386"> Spergel and Steinhardt </a> proposed that sufficiently strong self interactions among dark matter particles might resolve some structure formation puzzles, like the so-called Cusp vs. Core problem. Recent works have restricted the <a class="text-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06611"> bounds </a> on dark-matter self interactions further and favor <a class="text-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08088"> models </a> producing <a class="text-link" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03339"> velocity dependent </a> self scattering crosssections.

                In my Masters thesis I investigate a class of models for composite dark matter based on a strongly interacting gauge theory. In these scenarios, dark matter is made up of bound states of some fermions, called dark quarks. Due to the underlying new strong interaction, sufficiently large self interactions between the dark matter bound states are introduced. Furthermore, the stability of these states can be explained by an accidental flavor symmetry. This offers an explanation why we observe dark matter today.

                I focused on fermions that are charged under a real representation of various gauge groups. The prototypical theory is a SO(N) gauge theory with fermions in the vector representation.
                These theories are very different from the complex SU(N) theories, studied in the standard model of particle physics. 
                As it turns out, the reality condition is strong enough to qualitatively restrict all the low energy properties of the theory. The quantitative features manifest in the low energy effective constants, dependent on the choice of gauge group and representation. Additional features like additional discrete symmetries might show up when considering higher order tensor representation.
                The relevant particles my model describes are fermion-fermion bound states, called dark mesons. The lightest stable states are the pseudo-scalar PNGBs, called dark pions, of a spontaneous symmetry breaking scenario. Further, the lightest vector meson states (&rho;) and a pseudo-scalar flavor-singlet meson (&eta;'), related to the chiral anomaly, can be included in the low energy effective theory description by a combination the local hidden symmetry approach and Large N considerations.

                For dark matter phenomenology, the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) terms in the effective field theory play an important role. These describe the amplitudes of 3->2 interactios among pions, which drives the freeze-out process of thermal dark matter in the so-called <a class="text-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5143">SIMP</a> regime. 
                When restricting to a model with two Dirac fermion flavors, one encounters a topological obstruction that makes <a class="text-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0550321383900639">Witten's geometrical construction</a> of the WZW terms inconclusive. In order to circumvent this, one can use a method similar to the original approach of <a class="text-link" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9602093">Wess and Zumino</a>, which directly relates the UV-properties with the IR-description and obtains the WZW term as a solution to an "t'Hooft-anomaly-equation".

            These dark sector model may be viewed as standard model (SM) extension and can in order to describe thermal dark matter, must be coupled to the SM via a portal mediator. We investigated the case of a massive dark-photon mediator, kinetically mixing with standard model hypercharge. Although it is possible to choose charge assignments such that the dark pions remain stable, the dark &eta;' becomes unstable and may decay to the standard model.
            Since the SIMP regime prefers theories with larger gauge groups and thus large numbers of colors, the &eta;' might be close in mass to the dark pions and This might modify the estimates of the relic abundance of the dark matter

            Since the SIMP regime prefers theories with larger gauge groups and thus large numbers of colors, the &eta;' might be close in mass to the dark pions. Hence, this  might modify the estimates of the relic abundance of the dark matter or even spoil the model if the  &eta;' decays to quickly, depleting the all the dark matter. 
            However, doing the analysis demonstrated that even if the mass-split between  &eta;' and the pions becomes sufficiently small the  &eta;' is sufficiently stable. Effects on the relic abundance can at best improve the dark matter model, should the  &eta;' light enough to be in thermal equilibrium with the pions closely before freeze-out.

                Recently, theories of strongly interacting massive particles (SIMP) gained a lot of attention as explanation for dark matter on the level of particle physics. This class of theories features strong self-interactions among the dark matter particles, resolving the cusp vs. core problem and offer an explanation for the stability of dark matter. In this thesis I turn towards realizations of SIMP dark matter through non-abelian gauge theories with two Dirac fermions transforming under a real representation of the gauge group. The properties of the lightest pseudo-scalar meson, which constitute stable dark matter candidates in these theories, are studied. Special focus is put on the physics of a flavor-singlet meson, called η, which is the analogue of the η′ in QCD. A representation theoretical criterion, quantifying the phenomenological importance of the η-meson for dark matter phenomenology, is presented. We study how taking this particle into account modifies the estimates for the parameter space of these dark sector theories.

                We present a class of composite dark matter models with matter fields in a real representation under the non-abelian gauge group. As an exemplary theory we present a Sp(4) gauge theory, with fermions transforming in the antisymmetric representation. We analyze the structure of these theories in the UV and discuss the building blocks of the low energy effective theory in the IR, describing the dynamics of the cold dark matter. We put special focus on the construction of topological terms responsible for 3→2 cannibalization processes within the dark sector and on the physics of the pseudo scalar singlet related to the axial anomaly. We show that both these aspects significantly affect the freeze out calculation of the dark matter relic abundance and thus are relevant for investigations of the parameter space of such theories.

                In this thesis I construct and investigate confining gauge theories in order to look for models realizing the so-called strongly interacting massive particle (SIMP) regime of dark matter. The greatest appeal of these models is that the strong self-interactions between dark matter particles may resolve some problems in structure formation, like the cusp vs. core problem. After a short introduction to SIMPs, I will discuss gauge theories based on two Dirac fermions, transforming under a real representation of the classical groups, with focus on the symmetries, symmetry breaking and emerging light fermion bounds-states, relevant for dark matter phenomenology. The dynamics of the cold dark matter may be described by a low-energy effective theory, similar to chiral perturbation theory in QCD. For SIMPs, the interactions driving the freeze out process come from 5 point vertices related to topological terms of Wess-Zumino type. I discuss their construction as well as significance for the stability of dark matter, when trying to couple the dark sector to the standard model with a dark photon mediator.

                In the first part of this talk I would like to review some astrophysical observations, leading to the conclusion of a non-visible matter component.  While doing so, I focus especially on introducing and explaining the key notions in dark matter phenomenology as well as the underlying model assumption (often made implicitly). 
                In the second part of the talk, I will elaborate the concept of freeze out of a particle species in the context of dark matter. The goal is to establish a connection between the astrophysical observables and particle physics, illustrated by the WIMP Miracle.
                The overall purpose of the talk is to give a good overview how the fields of general relativity, thermodynamics and quantum field theory connect  in the field of dark matter phenomenology and to provide cross links between those fields, providing the background knowledge for future talks held by me or members of the research group on strongly interacting dark matter models at KFU Graz.
