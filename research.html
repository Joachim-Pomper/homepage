            One of the most prominent problems of modern physics is the mystery of Dark matter. Despite ample observational evidence from astrophysics, there is yet no commonly accepted explanation on the level of particle physics. Several models already have been proposed, among which so-called WIMP dark matter has been investigated most intensively. In the early 2000 <a class="text-link" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9909386"> Spergel and Steinhardt </a> proposed that sufficiently strong self interactions among dark matter particles might resolve some structure formation puzzles, like the so-called Cusp vs. Core problem. Recent works have restricted the <a class="text-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06611"> bounds </a> on dark-matter self interactions further and favor <a class="text-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08088"> models </a> producing <a class="text-link" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03339"> velocity dependent </a> self scattering crosssections.

                In my Masters thesis I investigate a class of models for composite dark matter based on a strongly interacting gauge theory. In these scenarios, dark matter is made up of bound states of some fermions, called dark quarks. Due to the underlying new strong interaction, sufficiently large self interactions between the dark matter bound states are introduced. Furthermore, the stability of these states can be explained by an accidental flavor symmetry. This offers an explanation why we observe dark matter today.

                I focused on fermions that are charged under a real representation of various gauge groups. The prototypical theory is an SO(N) gauge theory with fermions in the vector representation.
                These theories are very different form the complex SU(N) theories, studied in the standard model of particle physics. 
                As it turns out, the reality condition is strong enough to qualitatively restrict all the low energy properties of the theory. If point out differences between other real gauge theories and the prototypical SO(N) theory. The quantitative features manifest in the low energy effective constants, dependent on the choice of gauge group and representation. 
                The relevant particles my model describes are fermion-fermion bound states, called dark mesons. The lightest stable states are the pseudo-scalar PNGBs, called dark pions, of a spontaneous symmetry breaking scenario. Further, the lightest vector meson states (rho) and a pseudo-scalar flavor-singlet meson (eta), related to the chiral anomaly, are included in the low energy effective theory description.

                If restricting to a model with two Dirac fermion flavors, one encounters a topological obstruction that leads to the breakdown of <a class="text-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0550321383900639">Witten's geometrical construction</a> of the so-called "Anomalous" or "topological" terms in the effective field theory. We had to go back to the original approach of <a class="text-link" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9602093">Wess and Zumino</a>, which directly relates the UV-properties with the IR-description. This happens by investigation of anomalous Ward identities.
                These terms incorporate a 3->2 interaction of the pions which contributes to the freeze-out scenario of dark matter. This so-called <a class="text-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5143">SIMP</a> mechanism was proposed and investigated by the group around <a class="text-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07917">Yonit Hochberg</a>.

            The model may be viewed as standard model (SM) extension and can be coupled to the SM via a portal mediator. We investigate the case of a massive dark-photon mediator, kinetically mixing with standard model hypercharge. After the introduction of the mediator, dark matter annihilation into the standard model competes with the 3->2 process in the freeze-out. However, another decay channel opens with an anomalous vertex of the dark eta particle, and may influence the freeze-out regime of the SIMP mechanism.

                We present a class of composite dark matter models with matter fields in a real representation under the non-abelian gauge group. As an exemplary theory we present a Sp(4) gauge theory, with fermions transforming in the antisymmetric representation. We analyze the structure of these theories in the UV and discuss the building blocks of the low energy effective theory in the IR, describing the dynamics of the cold dark matter. We put special focus on the construction of topological terms responsible for 3→2 cannibalization processes within the dark sector and on the physics of the pseudo scalar singlet related to the axial anomaly. We show that both these aspects significantly affect the freeze out calculation of the dark matter relic abundance and thus are relevant for investigations of the parameter space of such theories.

                Dark matter makes up the majority of the mass in the universe. Despite ample observational evidence, dark matter has yet no explanation in particle physics. This drives construction of new particle physics theories which can lead to interesting explanations for the nature of dark matter. We present a new particle physics model where dark matter is a composite object much like pions in the Standard Model. Our model is based on a new gauge group -- Sp(4), with matter in antisymmetric representation rather than fundamental representation. We sketch the building blocks of this theory and explain how such theories are different from the usually encountered constructions in particle physics.

                In this thesis I construct and investigate confining gauge theories in order to look for models realizing the so-called strongly interacting massive particle (SIMP) regime of dark matter. The greatest appeal of these models is that the strong self-interactions between dark matter particles may resolve some problems in structure formation, like the cusp vs. core problem. After a short introduction to SIMPs, I will discuss gauge theories based on two Dirac fermions, transforming under a real representation of the classical groups, with focus on the symmetries, symmetry breaking and emerging light fermion bounds-states, relevant for dark matter phenomenology. The dynamics of the cold dark matter may be described by a low-energy effective theory, similar to chiral perturbation theory in QCD. For SIMPs, the interactions driving the freeze out process come from 5 point vertices related to topological terms of Wess-Zumino type. I discuss their construction as well as significance for the stability of dark matter, when trying to couple the dark sector to the standard model with a dark photon mediator.

                In the first part of this talk I would like to review some astrophysical observations, leading to the conclusion of a non-visible matter component.  While doing so, I focus especially on introducing and explaining the key notions in dark matter phenomenology as well as the underlying model assumption (often made implicitly). 
                In the second part of the talk, I will elaborate the concept of freeze out of a particle species in the context of dark matter. The goal is to establish a connection between the astrophysical observables and particle physics, illustrated by the WIMP Miracle.
                The overall purpose of the talk is to give a good overview how the fields of general relativity, thermodynamics and quantum field theory connect  in the field of dark matter phenomenology and to provide cross links between those fields, providing the background knowledge for future talks held by me or members of the research group on strongly interacting dark matter models at KFU Graz.
