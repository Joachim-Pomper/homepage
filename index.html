            <h2>Hello there!</h2>
            <!--<div style="font-weight:bold;">Welcome to my webpage!
                My name is  Joachim and I am a first year PhD student at the <a class="text-link" href="https://www.unipi.it/"> Università di Pisa</a>. I use this website to provide some information about me, my studies and future research interests, as well as to display a few projects I did in the past. Feel free to browse a little. If you are interested in getting in touch, don't hesitate to contact me.
            </div>-->
            My name is Joachim, and I am a first-year PhD student at the <a class="text-link" href="https://www.unipi.it/">Università di Pisa</a>. For my Bachelor and Master education I studied within the NAWI Graz Physics progamm, offered by the <a class="text-link" href="https://physik.uni-graz.at/en/">Karl Franzens University (KFU)</a> and the <a class="text-link" href="https://www.tugraz.at/en/fakultaeten/mpug/home/">Technical University of Graz (TU Graz)</a>. I concluded my sutides with a masters thesis on theorethical aspects of a specific class of strongly interacting dark matter theories, which I defended in July 2023.<br>
            
            My research interests revolve around aspects of fundamental physics, quantum field theory, and gravity. For most of my academic life, I was primarily involved in theoretical, almost mathematical, physics. In particular, I have a weakness for differential geometry and the use of differential forms. However, during my master's research, discussions with various experienced physicists slowly changed my perspective. While I remain fascinated by the ingenious ideas that fellow theoretical physicists have developed over the last decades, my PhD focuses on the reasonable question: "But can we measure this?" <br>

            And since the hype is real, I jumped onto the gravitational waves train. Using the new and current detectors as my observational tool of choice, I try to make predictions on exciting theoretical hypotheses in fundamental physics and develop new tools to eventually test them. My deep understanding of the involved theory has turned out to be quite helpful, while I have also learned about many interesting challenges on the observational side. At this stage, I really enjoy the balance between working with theory and observational/simulated data.
            <!--For my PhD I am exploring the testability of a quite exciting hyptohesis: The interplay between massless matter fields, like the photon, and quantum gravity may allow a breathing mode in the gravitational wave spectrum, without violating any fundamental assumptions of general relativity or the standard modell.  -->

            About me
            <hr>
        </h2>
        <div class="text-block">
            I was born 1997 in Graz, Austria. After high-school and civil-service I studied physics at the <a class="text-link" href="https://www.tugraz.at/home"> Technical University of Graz</a>. During that time I also developed a strong interest in abstract mathematics and visited additional courses in this direction. My physics bachelor degree I finished (2020) with a bachelor seminar paper on the Onsager solution for the two-dimensional Ising model via the use of Grassmann variables. During my last bachelor year (2019) I worked part-time in the renewable energy industry. However, I decided to participate in a joined physics master program at the <a class="text-link" href="#https://www.uni-graz.at/de/"> University of Graz </a> and the <a class="text-link" href="https://www.tugraz.at/home"> Technical University of Graz</a> in order to learn about quantum field theory and general relativity. My favorite courses have been the open topic seminar projects, which allowed me to study topics like static black holes, the functional renormalization group for fermions and particle creation in an expanding universe.  I finished my degree (2023) with a masters thesis on strongly interaction dark matter from (pseudo-)real QCD-like theories in the so-called SIMP regime. During my time as a student I had the chance to participate in teaching at the university as a teaching student assistant. Although I enjoyed tutoring at the black board a lot, the highlight was the preparation of lecture materials for a course (2021) on the use of differential forms in electromagnetism. For my PhD I accepted a position at the <a class="text-link" href="https://www.unipi.it/">Università di Pisa</a> (2023), where I am currently working on various aspects of gravitational waves.

To make the most of the opportunity, I traveled to the Dark Side of the Universe conference (DSU2022) in Sydney, Australia. I'm proud to say that my talk was extremely well received. I will never forget how people treated me completely differently before and after my talk—many did not take me seriously beforehand. After the conference, I stayed for an extra month during the winter vacation. Great times!</p>

                    <p>I presented the status and preliminary results of my master's thesis at the 71st Annual Meeting of the Austrian Physical Society (ÖPG2022). The conference was an extremely nice experience. </p>

                    <p>I participated in a summer school on the theoretical aspects of astroparticle physics, cosmology, and gravitation at the Galileo Galilei Institute (GGI). There, I had my first lecture on the subject of gravitational waves and early universe phase transitions. Due to the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, I could only participate online. </p>

                    <p>For this position, I was not supervising any students but was organizing lecture material for Professor Stefan Kurz in the form of presentation slides for his course on differential forms in electromagnetism. This has been my favorite position so far. Although I had never attended a course on the subject, Professor Kurz entrusted me with this task and incorporated many of my ideas on how to present certain topics to the students. </p>

                <p>I began to work 10 hours part-time at Best and received my own little project at the company, where I focused primarily on testing and developing software for hydraulic and thermal simulations for buildings and district heating grids. I really enjoyed working with the local team and often considered to join them again.</p>
