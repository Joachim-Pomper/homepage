        <div class="text-block">
            In 2016 I enrolled in
            <a class="text-link" href="https://www.tugraz.at/home"> Technical University Graz</a> to study physics. I had great fun studying Mechanics, Thermodynamics,  Electromagnetism, Fluid Mechanics, Special Relativity, Solid State Physics and Quantum Mechanics both theoretically and experimentally. For my third semester I got offered my first tutoring position in Linear Algebra for physicists. While preparing for the job I surprisingly discovered my fascination with abstract mathematics. Thus, during my physics bachelor, I continued to pick up several additional classes from the mathematics bachelor program.
        </div>
        <div class="text-block">
            At the end of my physics bachelor 2019, I began to work part-time for a company, developing automation and control systems for renewable energy grids. I was programming a simulation for heating grids, including thermal buffer storage and heat exchangers. During that time I took additional courses in mathematics on measure theory, numerics and functional analysis.

            In 2020 I started a masters program at the <a class="text-link" href="#https://www.uni-graz.at/de/"> University of Graz </a> with focus on quantum field theory and gravity. My first gravity course was rather disappointing, thus I turned more towards quantum theory. I had several positions as a teaching assistant, my favorite one however was to provide lecture material for Professor Stefan Kurz, from the  <a class="text-link" href="https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/">Technical University     Darmstadt</a>. He was giving a course on differential forms in Electromagnetism in the 2021 summer term. My newly sparked interest for geometry lead me to take on general relativity again on my own in the summer break 2021. Since then, I am fascinated with the subject! For my master thesis however I chose a very different topic. I figured I could try to do something more phenomenological for once. Also, I wanted to study strongly interacting gauge-theories more. During my thesis I learned a lot about spontaneous symmetry breaking, anomalies, homology, representation theory and effective field theories. 
            In winter 2022 I took a little break to travel to Australia, where I was invited to present some results of my masters thesis at <a class="text-link" href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/1107937/">DSU 2022</a>. Currently, I am writing up my thesis, while looking for a PhD position.

            One of the most prominent problems of modern physics is the mystery of Dark matter. Despite ample observational evidence from astrophysics, there is yet no commonly accepted explanation on the level of particle physics. Several models already have been proposed, among which so-called WIMP dark matter has been investigated most intensively. In the early 2000 <a class="text-link" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9909386"> Spergel and Steinhardt </a> proposed that sufficiently strong self interactions among dark matter particles might resolve some structure formation puzzles, like the so-called Cusp vs. Core problem. Recent works have restricted the <a class="text-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06611"> bounds </a> on dark-matter self interactions further and favor <a class="text-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08088"> models </a> producing <a class="text-link" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03339"> velocity dependent </a> self scattering crosssections.

                In my Masters thesis I investigate a class of models for composite dark matter based on a strongly interacting gauge theory. In these scenarios, dark matter is made up of bound states (dark pions) of some fermions (dark quarks). Due to the underlying new strong interaction, sufficiently large self interaction between the dark matter particles are introduced. Furthermore, the stability of the dark matter can be explained by an accidental flavor symmetry.

                My model focuses on fermions that are charged under a real representation, leaving the specific choice of gauge group and representation as an open parameter of the theory. As it turns out the reality condition is strong enough to qualitatively restrict all the low energy properties of the theory. The qualitative features manifest in the low energy effective constants, dependent on the choice of gauge group and representation. The behavior differs from the complex representation of QCD and SU(N) theories and resembles a more SO(N)-like theories.        
                The relevant particles my model describes are fermion-fermion bound states, called dark mesons. The lightest stable states are the pseudo-scalar PNGBs, called dark pions, of a spontaneous symmetry breaking scenario. Further the lightest vector meson states (rho) and a pseudo-scalar flavor-singlet meson (eta) related to the chiral anomaly are included are also described in the low energy effective theory.

                If restricting to a model with two Dirac fermion flavors, one encounters a topological obstruction that leads to the breakdown of <a class="text-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0550321383900639">Witten's geometrical construction</a> of the so-called "Anomalous" or "topological" terms in the effective field theory. We had to go back to the original approach of <a class="text-link" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9602093">Wess and Zumino</a>, which directly relates the UV-properties with the IR. This happens by investigation of anomalous Ward identities.
                These terms incorporate a 3->2 interaction of the pions which contributes to (and even may dominate) the freeze-out scenario of dark matter. This so-called <a class="text-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5143">SIMP</a> mechanism was proposed and investigated by the group around <a class="text-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07917">Yonit Hochberg</a>.

            The model may be viewed as standard model (SM) extension and can be coupled to the SM via a portal mediator. We investigate the case of a massive dark-photon mediator, kinetically mixing with standard model hypercharge. After the introduction of the mediator, dark matter annihilation into the standard model competes with the 3->2 process in the freeze-out. However, another decay channel opens with an anomalous vertex of the dark eta particle. At the last step of the project we investigate the freeze-out scenario in view of these 3 channels.

                We present a class of composite dark matter models with matter fields in a real representation under the non-abelian gauge group. As an exemplary theory we present a Sp(4) gauge theory, with fermions transforming in the antisymmetric representation. We analyze the structure of these theories in the UV and discuss the building blocks of the low energy effective theory in the IR, describing the dynamics of the cold dark matter. We put special focus on the construction of topological terms responsible for 3→2 cannibalization processes within the dark sector and on the physics of the pseudo scalar singlet related to the axial anomaly. We show that both these aspects significantly affect the freeze out calculation of the dark matter relic abundance and thus are relevant for investigations of the parameter space of such theories.

                Dark matter makes up the majority of the mass in the universe. Despite ample observational evidence, dark matter has yet no explanation in particle physics. This drives construction of new particle physics theories which can lead to interesting explanations for the nature of dark matter. We present a new particle physics model where dark matter is a composite object much like pions in the Standard Model. Our model is based on a new gauge group -- Sp(4), with matter in antisymmetric representation rather than fundamental representation. We sketch the building blocks of this theory and explain how such theories are different from the usually encountered constructions in particle physics.

                In the first part of this talk I would like to review some astrophysical observations, leading to the conclusion of a non-visible matter component.  While doing so, I focus especially on introducing and explaining the key notions in dark matter phenomenology as well as the underlying model assumption (often made implicitly). 
                In the second part of the talk, I will elaborate the concept of freeze out of a particle species in the context of dark matter. The goal is to establish a connection between the astrophysical observables and particle physics, illustrated by the WIMP Miracle.
                The overall purpose of the talk is to give a good overview how the fields of general relativity, thermodynamics and quantum field theory connect  in the field of dark matter phenomenology and to provide cross links between those fields, providing the background knowledge for future talks held by me or members of the research group on strongly interacting dark matter models at KFU Graz.

                This theses intends to provide a most elegant derivation of the exact analytic formula of the spontaneous magnetization of the 2d Ising-Model, dependent on temperature. A result which was first stated by Lars Onsager. In order to do so the combinatorial problem, encountered when trying to calculate the partition function of the system, is mapped onto an easier algebraic problem. This is done with the help of so-called Graßmann-numbers. Mathematical theorem, such as the Szegö's theorem, are used in order to perform the thermodynamic limit. This work restricts to isotropic, homogenous two-dimensional Ising lattices with periodic boundary conditions. The ideas of this derivation go back to works of Stuart Samuel, Elliot W.Montroll, Renfrey B. Potts und John C. Ward and are not a new result.

                In this project we consider a real scalar quantum field coupled in an expanding spatially-flat FLRW universe. The case of minimal and conformal coupling to the background metric are considered and for the FLRW scaling factor we picked the non-physical choice of a Sauter pulse. Due to the lack of an appropriate notion of time-translation symmetry, energy conservation is violated and one typically expects particle creation. The problem is analytically solvable in terms of hypergeometric functions and thus allows a nice discussion of the rate and amount of produced particles in terms of their mass, the expansion rate and the total expansion.

                In this project we treat a thought-experiment of an astronaut near the event Horizon of a static Black Hole, who drops a Probe into the Black Hole and measures the light signal transmitted by the Probe. We review the properties of the Schwarzschild spacetime in different charts, explain the disadvantages and ambiguities of the Schwarzschild chart and introduce non-pathological coordinates such as lightcone coordinates and Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates. The redshifts, null-geodesics, horizon as well as the introduction of a proper time-orientation on the spacetime are discussed. The apparent paradox, that the probe drops into the black hole after finite time without the astronaut ever observing, it is neatly explained and visualized by the use of these new coordinates in a Penrose diagram.

                In this project we derive the fermionic version of the Wetterich equation for the functional renormalization group flow and apply it to the Gross-Neveu model with N fermion flavors.  A simplistic ansatz for the quantum effective action allows for an analytic solution of the system. The flow equation and the running of couplings are calculated and discussed.
